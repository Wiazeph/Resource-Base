 * When the middleware bounces a signed-out user off a protected page it adds

 * redirect is explained rather than silent.
 *
 * The effect is driven by the param itself (not a one-shot ref): this
 * component lives in the persistent (site) layout and never remounts, so a ref
 * guard would swallow every bounce after the first. Stripping the param via
 * router.replace is what prevents re-firing.
