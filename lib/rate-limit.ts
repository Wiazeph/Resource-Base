 * KV-backed fixed-window rate limiter. Unlike the per-warm-instance Maps used in
 * some routes, KV is shared across all Worker isolates and survives cold starts,
 * so the limit is a real ceiling — an attacker can't reset it by forcing a new
 * isolate. Best-effort (KV is eventually consistent), which is exactly right for
 * abuse limiting: the window count may be off by one under a burst, never wildly.
 *
 * Limits here are set WELL ABOVE normal human usage — they only ever bite bots /
 * scripted spam. A real user toggling a favorite or editing their profile will
 * never come close, so there's no UX cost and no added latency on the happy path
 * (one KV get + one put, single-digit ms, and the callers run it server-side).
